    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1-2 bell peppers, chopped</li>
        <li>3-4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>Crushed red pepper flakes (to taste)</li>
        <li>6 vine ripe tomatoes, diced (or 28 oz canned whole tomatoes or 6 cups canned diced tomatoes)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>4-6 eggs</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley for garnish</li>
        <li>Crusty bread for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a little bit of extra virgin olive oil in a large, heavy skillet or pan with a lid over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onions, bell peppers, and garlic to the pan. Sauté the vegetables, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Season the vegetables with kosher salt, coriander, paprika, cumin, and crushed red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Cook for at least 5 minutes, stirring regularly, until the vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Add the fresh diced tomatoes and 1/2 cup of tomato sauce to the pan. If using canned tomatoes instead, add them at this stage.</li>
        <li>Bring the tomato mixture to a boil, then cover the pan and reduce heat to let it simmer for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover the pan and continue cooking for a few more minutes until the sauce has thickened to your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Using the back of a spoon, create small wells or holes in the sauce for the eggs.</li>
        <li>Crack each egg and carefully nestle it into one of the wells you created in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover the skillet and let the eggs simmer in the sauce over medium-low heat until the egg whites have set but the yolks remain soft and somewhat runny. For harder eggs, cook a bit longer.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs are cooked to your liking, remove from heat and garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately while hot, preferably with crusty bread for dipping into the delicious sauce and runny egg yolks.</li>
    </ol>
